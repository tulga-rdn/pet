PET
===

This repository contains an implementation of Point Edge Transformer (PET), interatomic machine learning potential, which achieves state-of-the-art on several datasets; see more details in [1]. PET is a graph neural network where each message-passing layer is given by an arbitrarily deep transformer. Additionally, this repository contains a proof-of-principle implementation of the Equivariant Coordinate System Ensemble (ECSE).

Installation
++++++++++++

Run :bash:`pip install .`

After the installation, the following command line scripts are available: :bash:`pet_train`, :bash:`pet_run`, and 
:bash:`pet_run_sp`. 

See the documentation for more details.

`LAMMPS <https://www.lammps.org/#gsc.tab=0>`_, `i-pi <https://ipi-code.org/i-pi/>`_, and `ASE.MD <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/md.html>`_ are molecular simulation engines.
 `MTM <https://github.com/lab-cosmo/metatensor-models>`_ allows to make an interface for models such as PET once and use them immediately in multiple simulation engines. (LAMMPS and ASE.MD are currently implemented, but a few others are planned in the future).

 All MD interfaces are currently under development and are not stable. :bash:`pet_train` and :bash:`pet_run` scripts are semistable now. 

"sp" = Symmetrization Protocol, refers to ECSE. 

MLIP stands for Machine Learning Interatomic Potential. Fitting is supported on energies and/or forces (it is recommended to always use forces). 
:bash:`pet_train_general_target` is intended for fitting multidimensional targets such as eDOS. Optionally, a target might be atomic, which means it is given for each atom in the structure, not for the whole atomic configuration. Derivatives are not supported forÂ this script.
